# QADT AEAC 2026 Software Repository

The purpose of this repository is to house all software associated with development environments, containers, computer vision, autonomy, and more pertaining to the AEAC 2026 competition developed by **Queen's Aerospace Design Team (QADT)**.

---

# Development Environment Setup

The below sections cover onboarding setups required to setup the QADT AEAC 2026 development environment for **WSL**, **dual boot Ubuntu Linux**, and **MacOS**.

---

## Prerequisite Learning Content

***You may refer to the resources in this section as you complete your onboarding.***

Learn some of the basics of **Linux** and navigating the terminal, **Docker**, and **Git**. Prioritize learning about Linux and complete the first few onboarding tasks until you reach the docker section. Review docker, and optionally you may begin learning git. Learning the basics of git will be ***necessary*** for future contributions to QADT Software.

---

## Prerequisite Setup 

**This step is REQUIRED for all operating systems.**

### Install VSCode

Install VSCode for your operating system from **[this link for Windows and MacOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**. **[Linux VSCode is covered in its instructions below](#setup---native-linux)**. We will be using the **Dev Containers** VSCode extension to download Docker images and open development containers inside VSCode.

### Create a GitHub Account

If you don’t already have a GitHub account:

1. Go to [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Follow the steps to create an account (I recommend that you create it under a personal email)
3. Verify your email address when prompted

Once your account is created, **sign in** and keep the page open — you’ll need it shortly when setting up SSH access and cloning repositories.

### Install the VSCode Extensions You’ll Need

Launch VSCode and install the following extensions (you can search for them in the Extensions tab on the left sidebar):

- **Dev Containers** – allows you to open and work inside Docker-based development environments  
- **Docker** – helps visualize and manage containers  
- **WSL** – (Windows only) lets VSCode connect to your WSL Ubuntu environment  

You can install them all at once by running this command in a terminal:

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
code --install-extension ms-azuretools.vscode-docker
```

---

## Setup - Windows

This project is developed and built inside Docker containers running on **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**. We will use **Ubuntu (latest)** as the default WSL distribution to keep the setup consistent across all contributors.

*In this guide, **WSL2** and **WSL** are used interchangeably; however, they both mean the same thing.*

The development workflow is:

1. **Run Docker alongside WSL2 (via Docker Desktop).**
2. **Build and run code inside of the development containers using VSCode.**
3. **Use Git inside WSL2** for source control.

### Install WSL2 and Ubuntu

For reference, here's Microsoft’s official guide: [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

To install WSL, open any terminal in windows and enter the following:

```bash
wsl --install
```

**TIME TO REBOOT!** Changes will not be made until the system is rebooted.

Then, confirm that you have wsl installed by entering the following:

```bash
wsl --version
wsl --list --verbose
```

Make sure Ubuntu is installed and set as the **default distribution**:

```bash
wsl --set-default Ubuntu
```

Confirm this by entering `wsl --status` and you should see the following:

```bash
$ wsl --status
------------------------------
Default Distribution: Ubuntu
Default Version: 2
```

To run WSL, **press the windows key and search WSL or Ubuntu** and launch the executable. Then run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

It will ask you to create a **username** - I always do `abotticchio` or `[firstInitial+lastname]`. It will also prompt you to create a password - **keep this light and short!** Keep in mind, when typing in your password in a terminal, *your characters won't show on screen* but will still be valid (this is a canon experience for first time linux users).

### Install Git in WSL

You want git available in your Ubuntu shell so you can clone our AEAC2026 repo. Enter the following in WSL:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
```

Verify by entering the following:

```bash
git --version # You should see output from this command
```

### Make an SSH Key

Now that Git is installed, let’s create an SSH key so you can securely authenticate with GitHub without typing your password every time.

First, generate a new SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

When prompted to **"Enter a file in which to save the key",** just press Enter (3 times) to accept the default path:

```bash
~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now, let’s copy your **public key** so you can add it to GitHub. Run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

This will print a line starting with `ssh-ed25519`. **Copy that entire line.**

Then:

1. Go to Go to your GitHub profile &rarr; **Settings** &rarr; **SSH and GPG Keys** &rarr; **New SSH Key**
2. Give it a recognizable title (e.g. “WSL Laptop”)
3. Paste your key into the **Key** field
4. Click **Add SSH key**

Finally, test your connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```bash
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you see this, then you're good to go!

### Clone the Repository

Inside WSL, make a **`git`** directory in your **home (`~`)** directory. This is where we will clone AEAC2026 and other git repositories into. First navigate to your home directory with `cd` or `cd ~` (using `cd` allows you to navigate directories, i.e `cd ~`), and make a `git` directory using `mkdir git` (using `mkdir` allows you to make directories, i.e `mkdir git`).

Then navigate into your git directory (`cd ~/git`) and clone the repo using SSH with `git clone <ssh_url>`. Your commands should look like this bellow:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir git
cd git
git clone git@github.com:Queen-s-Aerospace-Design-Team/AEAC2026.git
```

Enter `Yes` if you are cloning with SSH for the first time (i.e. just after making an SSH key).

### Install Docker Desktop

Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/). Docker desktop is a windows/mac application that will automatically detect running WSL instances and you'll be able to access **`docker`** commands within WSL without needing to install it explicitly.

During setup:
- Enable **WSL2 backend**.
- Integrate Docker Desktop with your **Ubuntu** WSL2 distribution.

After installation ensure that docker desktop is running on Windows. Then open a terminal in WSL and confirm Docker works:

```bash
docker --version
```

If this doesn't work, try restarting your environment by first quitting docker desktop, restarting WSL (press Cntrl + D in the WSL terminal to exit it), and try again.

### Open the AEAC2026 repo in VSCode

Now that Docker, VSCode, and Git are installed. We can now start pulling the docker container using the VSCode Dev Containers extension. We do this by opening the AEAC2026 repo in VSCode.

Personally, I like to do this using the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/git/AEAC2026
code .  # 'code' means VSCode, and we supply '.' as the current directory 
        # for the location we want to open VSCode into
```

We have a folder in the AEAC2026 repo called **`.devcontainer`**. This folder holds all the information required to create our development environment. Including the docker image (which is stored as a package on our GitHub organization), environment variables (defined in the `compose.yml` files), and other VSCode specific settings defined in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration file.

When opening VSCode, you should see a prompt asking to **Reopen in Container**, select yes. If you do not, you can trigger the same action by opening VSCode's command palette with `Cntrl/Command + Shift + P` and typing `>Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` then selecting that option.

After accepting the prompt the docker image will begin downloading. The entire process of opening the container should take 10 $-$ 15 minutes.

### Troubleshooting

- Pressing `Cntrl + D` in a WSL terminal will force a shutdown of WSL.
- Run `wsl --shutdown` in a **Windows terminal** and reopen Ubuntu.'
- Restart Docker by ending the process in the **tray** of your taskbar.

## Setup - Native Linux

*This project is developed and built inside Docker containers running on **Linux** with the help of VSCode's dev containers extension. Currently, the only linux distro this setup has been verified and tested on is **Ubuntu**.*

For installing Linux-Ubuntu, you are recommended to use **24.04** for default x11 rendering support (this is due to our container running Ubuntu 24.04 in which GUI apps mainly support x11, not wayland - namely Gazebo). Note that even on Wayland-based hosts (increasingly the default on newer Ubuntu releases), the devcontainer still works via XWayland — see `.devcontainer/initialize.sh`. I recommend choosing a minimal installation of Ubuntu when first installing from USB media and storage space of at least **96GB**. If installing alongside windows (i.e. Dual Boot), make sure to select **Install alongside Windows Boot Manager** - it the easiest this way. As with all Linux setup, you will have to select a PC name, username, and password. For a PC, I prefer the form `[firstName]-Ubuntu` (`anthony-Ubuntu`), and for username I prefer `[firstInitial][lastName]` (`abotticchio`) and choose an easy to type password.

After successfully installing Ubuntu, on reboot, open your BIOS settings and **set ubuntu to the top of the boot order** (above windows). Don't worry too much about this as you'll be able to select windows when booting into ubuntu from the GRUB boot menu. Then save changes and exit (usually by pressing F10) and boot into Ubuntu.

*There is no use of Docker Desktop on Linux machines. Instead, Docker recommends to use its own docker engine (no GUI).*

Generally, its a good idea to run `sudo apt upgrade` after installing a new OS:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y # '-y' auto accepts all upgrades
```

The development workflow is:

1. **Open development container inside of VSCode.**
2. **Build and run code inside of said development container**
3. **Use Git on Linux** for source control.


### Install Git

For Linux-Ubuntu, we’ll use its package manager **apt**, the package manager for Ubuntu distros, to install Git and other development tools.

To install Git, press the windows key and type in **terminal** into the search bar to open the terminal application. Enter the following:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
```

### Make an SSH Key

First, generate a new SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

When prompted to **"Enter a file in which to save the key",** just press Enter (3 times) to accept the default path:

```bash
~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now, let’s copy your **public key** so you can add it to GitHub. Run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

This will print a line starting with `ssh-ed25519`. **Copy that entire line.**

Then:

1. Go to Go to your GitHub profile &rarr; **Settings** &rarr; **SSH and GPG Keys** &rarr; **New SSH Key**
2. Give it a recognizable title (e.g. “Ubuntu Laptop”)
3. Paste your key into the **Key** field
4. Click **Add SSH key**

Finally, test your connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```bash
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you see this, then you're good to go!


### Clone the Repository

First navigate to your home directory with `cd` or `cd ~` (using `cd` allows you to navigate directories, i.e `cd ~`), and make a `git` directory using `mkdir git` (using `mkdir` allows you to make directories, i.e `mkdir git`).

Then navigate into your git directory (`cd ~/git`) and clone the repo using SSH with `git clone <ssh_url>`. Your commands should look like this bellow:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir git
cd git
git clone git@github.com:Queen-s-Aerospace-Design-Team/AEAC2026.git
```

If you’re cloning via SSH for the first time, you’ll be asked to confirm the connection — type **Yes** when prompted.

### Run the `setupLinux.sh` script

Inside the AEAC2026 repo, navigate to the scripts directory and run the `setupLinux.sh` script. This will install all required software on Linux machines including Docker, VSCode and its necessary extensions, and QGroundControl.

```bash
cd ~/git/AEAC2026/scripts
./setupLinux.sh
```

Next, reboot your computer and open VSCode in the repo with:

```bash
cd ~/git/AEAC2026
code .
```

## Setup - MacOS

*This project is developed and built inside Docker containers running on **MacOS** with the help of VSCode's dev containers extension. We currently do not use an other VMs or containers other than what is developed in-house and used inside of VSCode's dev containers extension.*

The development workflow is:

1. **Run Docker Desktop.**
2. **Open development container inside of VSCode.**
3. **Build and run code inside of said development container**
4. **Use Git on MacOS** for source control.

### Install Homebrew

For macOS, we’ll use **Homebrew**, the package manager for Mac, to install Git and other development tools.

To install Homebrew, open your **Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type “Terminal”, and hit Enter) and run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once installed, add Homebrew to your shell's PATH. For example:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

You can verify Homebrew is installed correctly with: 

```bash
brew --version
```

### Install Git with Homebrew

You want git available in your MacOS terminal so you can clone our AEAC2026 repo. Now that Homebrew is installed, user it to install Git:

```bash
brew install git
```

Verify by entering the following:

```bash
git --version # You should see output from this command
```

### Make an SSH Key

Now that Git is installed, let’s create an SSH key so you can securely authenticate with GitHub without typing your password every time.

First, generate a new SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

When prompted to **"Enter a file in which to save the key",** just press Enter (3 times) to accept the default path:

```bash
~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now, let’s copy your **public key** so you can add it to GitHub. Run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

This will print a line starting with `ssh-ed25519`. **Copy that entire line.**

Then:

1. Go to Go to your GitHub profile &rarr; **Settings** &rarr; **SSH and GPG Keys** &rarr; **New SSH Key**
2. Give it a recognizable title (e.g. “Mac Laptop”)
3. Paste your key into the **Key** field
4. Click **Add SSH key**

Finally, test your connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```bash
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

If you see this, then you're good to go!

### Clone the Repository

Inside your **home directory** (`~`). This is where you'll keep the AEAC2026 repository and any others you clone in the future. 

First navigate to your home directory with `cd` or `cd ~` (using `cd` allows you to navigate directories, i.e `cd ~`), and make a `git` directory using `mkdir git` (using `mkdir` allows you to make directories, i.e `mkdir git`).

Then navigate into your git directory (`cd ~/git`) and clone the repo using SSH with `git clone <ssh_url>`. Your commands should look like this bellow:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir git
cd git
git clone git@github.com:Queen-s-Aerospace-Design-Team/AEAC2026.git
```

If you’re cloning via SSH for the first time, you’ll be asked to confirm the connection — type **Yes** when prompted.

### Install Docker Desktop

Download and install [Docker Desktop for MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/). Docker Desktop allows you to run containers locally and integrates directly with VSCode.

After installation: 

- Make sure Docker Desktop is running (you should see the whale icon in your menu bar)
- Open a new terminal and verify Docker works with:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker commands don’t work immediately, try quitting and reopening Docker Desktop or restarting your terminal.

### Open the AEAC2026 repo in VSCode

Now that Docker, VSCode, and Git are installed. We can now start pulling the docker container using the VSCode Dev Containers extension. We do this by opening the AEAC2026 repo in VSCode.

Personally, I like to do this using the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/git/AEAC2026
code .  # 'code' means VSCode, and we supply '.' as the current directory 
        # for the location we want to open VSCode into
```

We have a folder in the AEAC2026 repo called **`.devcontainer`**. This folder holds all the information required to create our development environment. Including the docker image (which is stored as a package on our GitHub organization), environment variables (defined in the `compose.yml` files), and other VSCode specific settings defined in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration file.

When opening VSCode, you should see a prompt asking to **Reopen in Container**, select yes. If you do not, you can trigger the same action by opening VSCode's command palette with `Cntrl/Command + Shift + P` and typing `>Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` then selecting that option.

After accepting the prompt the docker image will begin downloading. The entire process of opening the container should take 10 $-$ 15 minutes.

After the container is open. **RESTART YOUR COMPUTER** to configure XQuartz (an application I installed onto your computer as part of the `initialize.sh` script). After this, it should be good to go.. 

### Troubleshooting

- If Docker isn’t responding, quit and restart Docker Desktop.
